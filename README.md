# Arduino-project-01
Me and my teammate had to solve a problem for a certain quest. Working with RFID, Arduino Nano, Internet and servo motors.  
We had to make an automized version of a riddle which invlolved balancing scales. Our system had to detect wether scales had been balanced in a right way, with objects summed up evenly, taking note of RFID layout. Then servo moved; our system also was connected to Internet and could receive signals over network.
